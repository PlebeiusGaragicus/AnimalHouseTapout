# INSTALL

install packages with `npm install`

You will also need to [Install MongoDB](./mongodb.md)

`.env` file should only be needed for development:

```sh
DEBUG=true
PORT=3000
```

# RUN

As easy as `./run`

Note: if that doesn't work ensure you change the permissions on the file with `chmod +x run`
