This is a personal project whose goal is to (1) help make my life a little easier and (2) teach me JavaScript as well as how to deploy, monitor and update a real-time application with multiple users on my own hardware.

The following documentaion is written for my future forgetful-self, but is also good practice for me at writing documentaion - which is often done last and given little effort.
